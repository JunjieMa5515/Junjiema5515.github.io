The model demonstrated excellent prediction accuracy and precision across different conditions. (My contributions- 80%: I am involved in original writing, data visualization, experimental validation, experimental platform setup, and data analysis.)"

The method was pre-trained in the Isaac Sim virtual environment and then deployed in an edge computing environment. The results show that this approach outperforms the control models in both virtual and real environments.
